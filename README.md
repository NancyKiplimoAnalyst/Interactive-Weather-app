# 🌤 Weather App — Demo

A single-page demo built with **plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks, no backend).  
Shows a simple current weather header and a 3-day forecast. Users can click **Change city** to enter a city and temperature via pop-ups.

**Privacy:** This is a front-end demo only — **no database is used and no personal data is collected, transmitted, or stored.**  
**Note:** This demo does **not** call any real weather API; temperatures are entered manually.
